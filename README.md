## About this Repo:
This repo is made majorly for two things
1. To know about [me](https://github.com/prasu93/)
2. To provide best resources or materials and efficient tutorials to the people, who are planning to make their way to the **Web-Development**
## Tools Recommended:
The preferred languages that you can use for developing github pages are:
- Markdown Language
- Hyper Text Markup Language, popularly known as HTML

People use Javascript, Ruby and other languages for performing some additional action items or applying few constraints for the web pages.

Links for your reference: [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

**Note**: Any efficient browser is fine and I would recommend [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjwqZPrBRBnEiwAmNJsNqOXRmog_4r60cVSsTN0Im_qLZvh__imowYwKzZAY1CSuz63h-lwPhoCV5gQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)(Windows) for publishing Github pages  because I'm using it :-)
